# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis-Model

A machine learning model for sentiment analysis built in python, trained and tested on a dataset of Twitter tweets (1.6 million). The model uses NLTK to preprocess the text data and Scikit-learn to perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The best hyperparameters are then used to train a Naive Bayes classifier, which is used to perform sentiment analysis on new tweets.
